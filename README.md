# Assignment 3 – City Transportation Network Optimization

Implementation of **Prim’s** and **Kruskal’s** algorithms to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a city’s transportation network.

## Features
- Reads graph input from a JSON file
- Runs both algorithms
- Outputs MST edges, total cost, operations count, and execution time
- Compares both algorithms’ performance
